# Telegram-bot-for-greetings
To use this code, you will need to replace "your_bot_token_here" with your actual bot token, which you can obtain by creating a new bot on the Telegram BotFather platform. Once you have replaced the bot token, you can run this code to start the bot, and it will respond to messages that include the "/hello" command with a warm greeting in English.
